## Microwave Atom Chip Design

<img src="/images/microwaveAtomChipDesignPaper.png" align="left" width="45%" hspace="10/>

One of my first major projects during my PhD was the simulation of a microwave atom chip based on microstrip transmission lines for trapping and manipulating ultra-cold atoms via the AC Zeeman (ACZ) effect. This paper outlines the design considerations for such an atom chip, as well as covers basic 2-level ACZ theory and provides analytic expression for the trap position for different wire/microstrip configurations (thanks to [Drew Rotunno](https://rotunno.party/projects)). One of the more interesting things we found was how the proximity effect alters the current distribution in the chip traces based on the relative phase between microwave currents.
