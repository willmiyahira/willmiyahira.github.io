## Microwave Source with Digital Phase Control

## Microwave Atom Chip Design

<img src="/images/microwaveAtomChipDesignPaper.png" align="left" width="45%"/>
One of my first major projects during my PhD was the simulation of a microwave atom chip based on microstrip transmission lines for trapping and manipulating ultra-cold atoms via the AC Zeeman (ACZ) effect. This paper outlines the design considerations for such an atom chip, as well as covers basic 2-level ACZ theory and provides analytic expression for the trap position for different wire/microstrip configurations (thanks to [Drew Rotunno](https://rotunno.party/projects)). One of the more interesting things we found was how the proximity effect alters the current distribution in the chip traces based on the relative phase between microwave currents.

## Dipoles in Quantum Field Theory
<img src="/images/dipolesInQFTPaper.png" align="left" width="25%"/>
This work came during a summer working with Dr. David Latimer at the University of Puget Sound. We show that in the low-energy limit, one can derive the classical electric and magnetic fields of a pure dipole from quantum field theory (QFT) calculations. There's also a nice section on Fourier transforms as welll.

## Dampened Drum Mode Decay
<img src="/images/ESPIimage.png" align="left" width="40%"/>
As a drummer and percussionist, I often put something on the head of the drum (i.e. a wallet, Moongel, etc.) to eliminate high-frequency pitches when the drum is struck. I brought the idea of studying how using these dampeners effect the decay times of the different normal modes of the drum to Dr. Randy Worland at the University of Puget Sound, who has expertise in the physics of musical accoustics. One of the best parts of this work was being able to use an electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI) to image the normal modes of a drum in real time. In the picture you can actually see the shape of the normal modes! We were able to use a spectrum analyzer in waterfall mode to measure the decay rates of different modes to pin down which rang out when struck and measure how the addition of a dampener causes certain modes to decay faster.
