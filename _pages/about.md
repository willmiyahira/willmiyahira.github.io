I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the College of William & Mary working in the [Ultra-cold Atom Lab](https://saaubi.people.wm.edu/ResearchGroup/index.html) of Dr. Seth Aubin. Our lab aims to utilize ultra-cold atoms trapped using a microfabricated magnetic chip trap to make precision measurements of inertial forces and fundamental interactions. You can learn more about my work under the Research tab.

When not shooting lasers at atoms in our basement lab, I'm an avid rock climber and drummer, a beginner mountaineer (so far have done the Grand Teton and Mt. Baker!) and ocassionally mess around with some hobby electronics/3D printing/coding.
