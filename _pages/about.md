I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the College of William & Mary working in the [Ultra-cold Atom Lab](https://saaubi.people.wm.edu/ResearchGroup/index.html) of Dr. Seth Aubin. Our lab aims to utilize ultra-cold atoms trapped using a microfabricated magnetic chip trap to make precision measurements of inertial forces and fundamental interactions.
