          During the COVID-19 lockdown period, I would often talk or play games with friends over Zoom. I eventually came up with a question and answer game not unlike the hit show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire". In the beginning I would keep track of everyone's (sometimes up to 8-10 players) by hand. Since this was around the time I was starting to teach myself how to code in Python, I thought a good project would be to develop a GUI for keeping track of multiple player's points for a game.
