      <h2>Peg Board for Climbing Gear</h1>
      
      <p>
         Scrolling my Instagram feed I stumbled upon a great way to organize my climbing gear in an aesthetically pleasing way using a peg board. Here I'll document the steps I used to install the board for others interested in doing the same or if I ever want to hang up another one.
      </p>

      <h3>Setup and Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do is choose the space where you want to install the peg board. It's important to not here that the gear will end up extending about a foot (could be more or less depending on what gear you hang and the pegs you choose), so you'll to choose a space with sufficient room in front of the board. Depending on the size of your space, the equipment listed below may not match your needs exactly, but you can easily buy more or less of the materials to fit your project.

        I used the following materials and tools for my build:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2' x 4' peg board (<a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-48-in-H-x-24-in-W-White-Pegboard-109099/202093803">Link</a>) -- $12.24</li>
        <li>Assorted Peg Hooks (<a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-4-in-Zinc-Plated-Steel-Peg-Hook-Assortment-Kit-32-Piece-18031/202305511">Link</a>) -- $9.98</li>
        <li>35 lbs 1/4" diameter drywall anchors (<a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Triple-Grip-TripleGrip-8-Grey-Plus-black-and-White-Screws-5-Piece-and-5-Piece-171SDBW/310261755">Link)</a> -- $7.93</li>
        <li>2-1/2" long 1/4" diameter coarse drywall screws -- $7.28 for a 1 lb box</li>
        <li>Power Drill</li>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
      </ul>

        The total cost of this project for me was about $35. I only included the cost of items I had to purchase. This project could cost more or less depending on if you already have some of the materials, or want to paint the peg board, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll make an important note here. If you search online for doing this project most people will suggest using furring strips to attach to the studs in your wall and attaching the pegboard to that. In cases where you intend on putting a lot of weight onto the pegboard (i.e. hanging climbing ropes, bags, or just a lot of gear in general), YOU SHOULD DO THAT. Since I'm only planning on using this peg board to hold under 20 lbs (the gear I currently have on in the picture at the end totals to less than 10 lbs), then using the drywall anchors is sufficient. If you're in the same boat as me, great, otherwise check out another tutorial.
      </p>

      <h3>Planning and Drilling Holes</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have the space picked out, you'll need to mark out where to drill the holes for hanging the peg board. Using the level, adjust the peg board on the wall and use a pencil to mark out where the holes will be drilled. It is also useful to mark which holes on the pegboard you will use for hanging. I went with five holes: one at each corner and one in the center. Then, using a 1/4" drill bit, drill holes through the drywall at the marked locations. I used a stud finder to ensure that I wouldn't accidentally drill into any studs, but I'm not actually sure if that part is necessary. Then, insert the drywall anchors into the holes and use a hammer to get them flush with the wall.
      </p>

      <h3>Putting in the Peg Board</h3>
      <p>
        Using the 2-1/2" screws and peg board spacers that come with the assorted hooks, attach the peg board to the wall. I found it useful to use a piece of tape to secure the spacers to the back of the peg board so that they didn't fall off while attaching. This step is also made significantly easier with a couple of helping hands.

      <h3>Organize and Enjoy!</h3>
      <p>
        Now that the board is up you can fully customize the organization of your climbing gear! In total this project only took an hour or two and I think it turned out really well. The board doubles as both a convinent method of storing and organizing your gear and also has a unique aesthetic in my mind. Best of luck to those who also do this project and enjoy!
